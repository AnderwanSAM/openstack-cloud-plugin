    Creates an Openstack <code>Instance</code> object, from an already globally defined cloud name and label without registering it as a Jenkins agent. </br>
    This step has a third optional String parameter, named scope, reflecting the booted Server scope, with possible values from:</br>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>run</code></dt>
        <dd>The booted Instance will be kept alive whilst the current run is kicking. This is the default mode if no scope is defined.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>run:JOB_NAME:BUILD_NUMBER</code></dt>
        <dd>The booted Instance will be kept alive whilst the run defined with JOB_NAME:RUN_ID is kicking.
        </dd>
        <!-- <dt><code>time:DATE</code></dt>
        <dd>The booted Instance will be kept alive until DATE (formatted as yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss).
        </dd> -->
        <dt><code>unlimited</code></dt>
        <dd>The booted Instance will be kept alive forever. Mind the possible resources extarvation at the Openstack provider!
        </dd>
