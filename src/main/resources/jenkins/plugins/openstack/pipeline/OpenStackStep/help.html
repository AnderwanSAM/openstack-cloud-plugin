<div>
    Creates an Openstack <code>Instance</code> object, from an already globally defined cloud name and label without registering it as a Jenkins agent. </br>
    This step has a third optional String parameter, named scope, reflecting the booted Server scope, with possible values from:</br>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>run</code></dt>
        <dd>The booted Instance will be kept alive whilst the current run is kicking. This is the default mode if no scope is defined.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>unlimited</code></dt>
        <dd>The booted Instance will be kept alive forever. Mind the possible resources extarvation at the Openstack provider!
        </dd>
    </dl>
</div>
